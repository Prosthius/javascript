/*3. Backticks:*/ `Hello`

//Double and single quotes are 'simple' quotes. Virtually no difference.
//Backticks are extended functionality quotes.
//They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${â€¦}, for example:

let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

// embed an expression
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3
